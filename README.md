# DriverPass Summary
The DriverPass project's purpose was to help DriverPass design and implement a new system from the ground up to help their customers better prepare themselves through a course of in-person driving instruction and online study materials with practice tests so that they would have a better chance of passing their driving test. The strength of my work would be that breaking down the system into its repsective parts and how it should flow. My improvements would mainly be to go into more hard specifics on the details of how the system would work. I tend to think in more overarching terms.
# Strengths and Weaknesses
After having a thorough meeting to find out as much detail on how the users wanted the system to work, I took them and applied them to their end goal of what they wanted to produce making sure that each element would mesh with the others appropriately. 
# User's Needs
It is always important to find out what your user needs. If you design a something that does not meet them, at best you have a system that will only do part of what they want. At worst, it does not work at all, and you probably will not get paid after wasting all the time building a system that is not what was wanted.
# Design Approach
The first step in desiging is always going to be to find out what the user wants for the system. Also important is the budget allowed for the project. From there, break down the requirements and sketch out diagrams showing the general ideas of how the system will flow. Decompose each section until you hit a primitive level on each. Going forward, I will be using the different UML diagrams more extensively. I found them to be exceedingly helpful in trying to design how the system would work.
